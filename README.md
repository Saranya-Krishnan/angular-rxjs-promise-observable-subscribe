# angular-rxjs-promise-observable-subscribe

Simple experiment with RxJS into Angular
In this project you can meet the following modules:

    promise - Using a promise.
    observable - Creating a simple Observable.
    subject - Creating a Subject with a late subscription.
    async-subject - Creating an AsyncSubject.
    behavior-subject - Creating a BehaviorSubject.
    replay-subject - Creating a ReplaySubject.
    observable-unicast - Observables are unicast by default.
    subject-multicast - We can use a subject to make an observable hot and multicast.
    cold-and-hot   - Observables are cold and hot
    from-promise - Observable out of a promise from fetch('/api/endpoint')
    observable-counter - Observable publish a value on an interval
    from-event  - Observable publish mouse movements
    operators  - Observable of transformed values by function
    pipe-function - Observable pipe() function
    event-emitter - When you call emit(), it passes the emitted value to the next() method of any subscribed observer.
    async-observable-pipe   - The AsyncPipe subscribes to an observable or promise and returns the latest value it has emitted.
    rxjs-form   - Practically use RxJS with Angular Forms. Angular expose observables to chain common RxJS operators together. And how to implement the same solution without an observable chain.
